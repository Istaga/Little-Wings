# Little Wings  

## About
Little Wings was a game developed for children, using speech recognition for some player controls. The game uses PhD-backed research from my supervising professor to help children with a form of anxiety called selective mutism to speak more often and overcome their anxiety. The methodology involves slowly introducing the user to blow into the microphone, then using short words, and then longer words.

This version you see on Git is before I switched to Unity's source control system
